                    Hi, I'm Lachie, better known as YottaByte. I make games and stuff when I feel like it and don't when
                    I
                    don't.
                    This is a collection of the products of the rare times when I actually felt like making games.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In case it's not blatantly obvious, this site is a work-in-progress.
                </p>
